## WHAT IS SAP Conversational AI?

We build products to help enterprises and developers have a better understanding of user inputs.

-   **NLP API**: a unique API for text processing, and augmented training.
-   **Bot Building Tools**: all you need to create smart bots powered by SAP Conversational AI's NLP API. Design even the most complex conversation flow, use all rich messaging formats and connect to external APIs and services.
-   **Bot Connector API**: standardizes the messaging format across all channels, letting you connect your bots to any channel in minutes.

**Don't reinvent the wheel, simply fork it from the best!**

SAP Conversational AI is a **community platform**: just like on GitHub, you can fork any bot or intent to speed up your bot development. Discuss with other bot makers in the community [on our Slack](https://slack.cai.tools.sap/) to learn all the tips and tricks.

## GETTING STARTED

The bot builder gives you access to: 

-   A **visual interface** to design the flow, build the conversation logic and set up replies.

-   **Webhook features** to connect your bot to your own API or other services to fetch external data.
